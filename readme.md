 replbot
=========

This is a work-in-progress Twitter bot, implemented in Kawa Scheme, intended for Heroku

It currently just responds to tweeted Scheme expressions by evaluating them; the goal is to respond with images after a user tweets in with a piece of shader code (using a more concise custom language optimized for tweeting). Ideally we want users to be able to define functions in one tweet and use them in another, too.
